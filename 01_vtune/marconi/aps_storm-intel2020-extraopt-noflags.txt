| Your application is MPI bound. This may be caused by high busy wait time

| possible performance bottlenecks.

  Memory Stalls:                              37.20% of pipeline slots
| The metric value can indicate that a significant fraction of execution
| pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load and stores. See the
| second level metrics to define if the application is cache- or DRAM-bound and
| the NUMA efficiency. Use Intel(R) VTune(TM) Profiler Memory Access analysis to
| review a detailed metric breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory bandwidth
| information, and correlation by memory objects.

| The system spent much time heavily utilizing DRAM bandwidth. Improve data
| accesses to reduce cacheline transfers from/to memory using these possible
| techniques: 1) consume all bytes of each cacheline before it is evicted (for
| example, reorder structure elements and split non-hot ones); 2) merge
| compute-limited and bandwidth-limited loops; 3) use NUMA optimizations on a
| multi-socket system. Note: software prefetches do not help a bandwidth-limited
| application. Run Intel(R) VTune(TM) Profiler Memory Access Analysis to
| identify data structures to be allocated in High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), if
| available.
